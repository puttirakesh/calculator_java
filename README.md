Sure, here's an explanation of each line of the code:

import java.util.Scanner; --> This line imports the Scanner class from the java.util package, which is used to read input from the user.
public class Calculator { --> This line declares a public class named Calculator.

public static void main(String[] args) { --> This line declares the main method, which is the entry point of the program.
Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in); --> This line creates a new Scanner object named scanner that reads input from the console.

while (true) { --> This line starts an infinite loop that will continue to run until it is interrupted by a break statement.
System.out.println("\nEnter the first number (or 'q' to quit):"); --> This line prints a message to the console asking the user to enter the first number or 'q' to quit.
String input1 = scanner.next(); --> This line reads the user's input as a string and stores it in the input1 variable.

if (input1.equalsIgnoreCase("q")) { --> This line checks if the user's input is 'q' (ignoring case). If it is, the loop is interrupted with a break statement.
int number1 = Integer.parseInt(input1); --> This line converts the user's input from a string to an integer and stores it in the number1 variable.
System.out.println("Enter the second number:"); --> This line prints a message to the console asking the user to enter the second number.
int number2 = scanner.nextInt(); --> This line reads the user's input as an integer and stores it in the number2 variable.

System.out.println("Please type in the math operation you would like to complete:");     --> This line prints a message to the console asking the user to enter a math operation.
System.out.println("+ for addition");        --> This line prints a message to the console explaining how to perform addition.
System.out.println("- for subtraction");     --> This line prints a message to the console explaining how to perform subtraction.
System.out.println("* for multiplication");  --> This line prints a message to the console explaining how to perform multiplication.
System.out.println("/ for division");        --> This line prints a message to the console explaining how to perform division.
System.out.println("q to quit");             --> This line prints a message to the console explaining how to quit the program.

String operation = scanner.next(); --> This line reads the user's input as a string and stores it in the operation variable.
double result = 0; --> This line initializes the result variable to 0.

switch (operation) { --> This line starts a switch statement that checks the value of the operation variable.
case "+": --> This line is one of the cases in the switch statement that checks if the operation variable is '+'.
result = number1 + number2; --> This line calculates the result of the addition operation and stores it in the result variable.
break; --> This line exits the switch statement.

case "-": --> This line is another case in the switch statement that checks if the operation variable is '-'.
result = number1 - number2; --> This line calculates the result of the subtraction operation and stores it in the result variable.
break; --> This line exits the switch statement.

case "*": --> This line is another case in the switch statement that checks if the operation variable is '*'.
result = number1 * number2; --> This line calculates the result of the multiplication operation and stores it in the result variable.
break; --> This line exits the switch statement.

case "/": --> This line is another case in the switch statement that checks if the operation variable is '/'.
result = number1 / number2; --> This line calculates the result of the division operation and stores it in the result variable.
break; --> This line exits the switch statement.
